**A Digital Twin of Future Inclusive and Decarbonised Public Transportation Services**
Partner: Liverpool City Region
Project reference: LV64

The Liverpool City Region (LCR) Combined Authority (CA) has a target to reach net zero carbon across the LCR by 2040. A key element of achieving this ambition will relate to  the type of public transportation that is offered within LCR and how mobility is organised across these integrated networks. Within this context, it is very important that the benefits of decarbonised public transportation are inclusive and support the economic growth of the LCR.

This project will develop a digital model of public transportation and its use across the LCR, integrating data from existing services alongside demographic and economic information. Within the context of potential future strategies and those that are already developed (e.g. Local Transport Plan, Transport for the North), this project will develop a simulation enabling evaluation of their impact on net zero carbon targets. The project will also explicitly evaluate how traditional transportation appraisal methods might be adapted to better reflect net zero carbon ambitions as an enabler for new transportation schemes to be funded and introduced.

**A Digital Twin of Resilient Future Retail Centres for Post Pandemic Social and Economic Recovery**

Partner: Liverpool City Region
Project reference: LV63

Retail centres provide a hub for social and economic interactions, playing an important role in supporting  the economy and our communities including both leisure and cultural activities.  Changing consumer preferences  that include the impact of online retail are however affecting the sustainability of some retail centres, trends that have been exacerbated during the pandemic. There is a clear need to better understand how the functions and use of retail centres are changing (and why), and how they can be best managed and supported to plan for a sustainable and resilient recovery from the pandemic.

This project will develop a Digital Twin of retail centre form and function within Liverpool City Region, embedding a range of data about the dynamics of retail centre use and their characteristics. Working in partnership with Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and other retail stakeholder, models will be developed to test scenarios for enhancing recovery and ensuring greater future retail centre resilience.

**Detecting Population and Built Environment Change from Space and their Impacts on Buried Utility Assets**

Partner: MGIS
Project reference: LV62

Advances in Satellite and Earth observation technology are creating new ways in which we can study  the interrelationships between populations and those places within which they live. This is creating great opportunities for the study of human dynamics through the lens of changes to the built environment; and provides a new set of  reference points for those companies focused on delivery of services at this intersection.

MGISS are based within Liverpool City Region and have a vision to be a global leader in the use of Geospatial technology, location intelligence and advanced analytics to improve the long-term resilience of critical infrastructure such as buried utilities (water, gas, electricity, telco) and also major transportation networks.

The core of this project will involve the application of machine learning and AI (e.g. Classification / spectral mixture models) to satellite data to extract information on changes in human activity, and will additionally benefit from the close coupling of insight from MGISS, available asset owner data, environmental data and other ancillary sources such as planning application and approvals. Substantively this project will likely explore various observable changes such as infrastructure development (planned and in progress) and potential for identification of past, imminent, and future potential supply interruption impacts.

**Understanding Population Dynamics for Health and Safety Risk Assessment**

Partner: Health and Safety Executive
Project reference: LV61

This project would consider those methods and data that enable a better understanding of what drives footfall and activity in different areas of cities and towns. This context would extend the work HSE regularly does to create a National Population Database adding greater emphasis on dynamics through the integration of new forms of data such as social media, phone records, or sensor data. In this context, the project would build a model that combines traditional and new data to generate temporal estimates of the volume of people and relate this to its impact on health and safety.

For details on how to apply, see the main CDT website - https://datacdt.org/entry-criteria-applying/ ; finally – if these don’t quite fit your interests – we also have a student led application process too: https://datacdt.org/student-led-projects/
