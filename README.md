## Assistant Professor / Lectureship 

University of Liverpool: 2 X Lecturer in Geographic Data Science Grade 8

Continuing recent strategic investment and growth of the Department of Geography and Planning, we are recruiting a Lecturer in Geographic Data Science in the area of Human Geography - whose research complements current activity within the Geographic Data Science Lab (GDSL) research group (https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) and links to other research groups across the School, and particularly Planning, Environmental Assessment and Management and the Power Space and Cultural Change research groups (https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geography-and-planning/research/). We are especially interested in applicants with international research expertise in the application of geographic data science, and one or more of the following priority areas: population, health, urban analytics, human mobility, transport and spatial inequalities. We would also be particularly interested hearing from applicants with a background in machine learning / artificial intelligence (AI) and network science to social science and population questions. The post has the potential to align strategically with the University’s Digital, ‘Starting well, living well, ageing well’, Personalised health, and Climate Futures research themes. We particularly welcome applications from scholars who identify with groups who continue to be underrepresented and who face barriers to inclusion in higher education. We believe that a diverse and supportive environment, bringing different perspectives to our work and allowing people to blossom is the best platform for excellent teaching.
